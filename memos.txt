- Every peer knows some of the other peers (ones they have had to interact with in the past)
- Network discovery works with advertisements
- Asymmetric key verification
- Database cleanup

RSA-Encryption




Peer group layer
	- supports queries, relayed pipes and multicasting? Private groups can be configured to allow direct connections.
		- Limit on how many queries/multicasts a peer can send and forward per second
	- private/public keys to ensure authenticity
	- Traffic mostly encrypted
	- Hard/"Impossible" to pinpoint origin IP if the group is anonymous
	- IP =/= Peer

Network layer
	- Works with advertisements
		- Advertisements relay information like available STUN servers or potential neighbors
		- Advertisements are saved locally and published
		- Nodes can query neighbor nodes for advertisements, but these queries are not forwarded to neighbors' neighbor's.
	- Forwards messages to neighbors
		- Exponential Decay Bloom Filter?
		- Hash table?
		
		

To fix later
	- Attacker can overflow a neighbor by sending Advertisement response packets with fake information and potentially steer the target to a separate infected network
		- Only accept so many ARRP packets from a single neighbor?
	- Attacker can initiate lots of connections with a single peer to push legitimate peers out of it's pipe queue.
		- Maybe mark some neighbors as "want-to-keep"?
