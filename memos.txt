Maybe a distributed database type user database
- Every peer knows some of the other peers (ones they have had to interact with in the past)
- Works with advertisements
- Newer advertisements rewrite older ones with timestamps
- Modifications that don't come directly from the user have to be verified by multiple peers
- Asymmetric key verification
- Database cleanup

RSA-Encryption



Application layer
	- Developer decides

Peer group layer
	- supports queries, relayed pipes and multicasting? Private groups can be configured to allow direct connections.
		- Limit on how many queries/multicasts a peer can send and forward per second
	- private/public keys to ensure authenticity
	- Traffic mostly encrypted
	- Hard/"Impossible" to pinpoint origin IP
	- IP =/= Peer

Network layer
	- Works with advertisements
		- Advertisements relay information like available STUN servers or potential neighbors
		- Advertisements are saved locally and published
		- Nodes can query neighbor nodes for advertisements, but these queries are not forwarded to neighbors' neighbor's.
	- Forwards messages to neighbors using some algorithm (undecided)
		- Exponential Decay Bloom Filter
		- Hash table
		
		
Do i need commons-codec?
